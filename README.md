# Blockchain JS

A minimalist, experimental block chain protocol implemented in Javascript.

This is meant as an educational resource - I will be writing a tutorial soon to explain blockchain concepts using this codebase.

The code contains full cryptographic security measures, such as SHA256 block hashing, public/private wallet keypair generation, and ECDSA transaction signing and verification.

This is an experimental, work-in-progress codebase.
